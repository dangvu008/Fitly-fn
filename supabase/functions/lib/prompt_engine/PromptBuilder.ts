/**
 * File: prompt_engine/PromptBuilder.ts
 * Purpose: Assembles dynamic prompts from modular PromptBlocks based on SceneContext.
 * Layer: Application
 * Domain: Try-On Prompt Generation
 *
 * Covers all 32 scenarios across 4 groups:
 *   Nhóm 1 (#1-#11): Single items — top, bottom, dress, outerwear, shoes, hat, eyewear, bag, jewelry, scarf, belt
 *   Nhóm 2 (#12-#17): Outfit combos — top+bottom, full outfit, +accessories, layering, dress+outerwear, swap single
 *   Nhóm 3 (#18-#25): User image variants — full body, half body, angled, sitting, bulky clothes, multi-person, complex bg, low quality
 *   Nhóm 4 (#26-#32): Product image variants — flatlay, mannequin, worn, single angle, multi-variant, cropped, watermark
